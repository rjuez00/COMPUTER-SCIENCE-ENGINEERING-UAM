# COMPUTER-SCIENCE-ENGINEERING-UAM

These are all the practices I could recover. Although there are some subjects I couldn't partially recover all practices due to coordinations with my previous partners this could help people that want to see how Computer Science Engineering in UAM (Grado de Ingeniería Informática Bilingüe de la Autónoma).
Some subjects were attended in Spanish while others in English, I'm aware that the bilingual degree has been discontinued in this university due to lack of resources but the contents are the same in Spanish and English so it can help you anyway.

Some of the languages used during my practices are:
```C, Java, Python, VHDL, x86, MIPS, Prolog, Bison, PostgreSQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript...```
There are also subjects like SEPRO and INGS where we did technical documentation for software engineering projects.

I hope this helps someone, I'm currently starting my final year, as I complete more projects I will add them here.
