/**
 * @brief Create a Player module that integrates the necessary functionality to manage
 * players, also in a similar way as the player module does for spaces. In particular,
 * players must be implemented as a data structure with the following fields:
 * identification, name, location (a player identifier where the player is located) and
 * an object (storing the object identifier the player is carrying). In addition, it must
 * be included the necessary functions to create and destroy players (create and
 * destroy), change the values of their fields (set and get) and print the content
 * (print) as in the previous case.
